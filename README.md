## Fitness Function
- Outputs: Should the bird jump or do nothing?
- Inputs: Distance from Top Pipe, Bottom Pipe, Floor
- The birds are rewarded for each second they are alive, and each pipe the successfully traverse. The birds lose fitness everytime they collide with an object
- Config-Feed Forward has more information about the exact functions used, generation information, and parameters.

## How to Run
